# 2024S-Code-Avengers (Book Buddy)

This repo is my fork of the capstone project I completed for my Masters in Computer Science. I was the lead developer in a team of 8 and we preacticed Agile software development that split our semester into 4 different sprints. I created this to continue fine-tuning and working on the project after the semester was completed.
